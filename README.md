# to-do-list-py

I opted a Guided Project from Coursera Learning Platform. In that module, a simple To-Do List App was created using Python language. I have extended that project and prepared the code that user's inputs will be saved in .txt file. So, user can access his/her past input data as well.

Thank You!
